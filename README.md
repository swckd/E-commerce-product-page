# E-commerce product page

![Live web preview for the E-commerce product page coding challenge](./assets/images/desktop-screenshot.gif)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I have built out this e-commerce product page from a Figma file.

I have used HTML 5, SASS and Javascript, all in Bootstrap 5.

Your should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- The lightbox gallery is disabled on mobile
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
